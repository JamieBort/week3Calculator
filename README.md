**Build a Calculator**  

This exercise will help you understand how to use JavaScript functions and algorithms. You will also work with the DOM and respond to user input.

Step 1: Set up your project

* Create an `index.html` file
* Create a main.css file and link it to your index.html file
* Create a main.js file and link it to your index.html file
Step 2: Build the HTML

* Using the mockup provided below, create your HTML
Step 3: Apply the Styles

* Author CSS to match your HTML page to the mockup below.
Step 4: Write the JavaScript

* Writing the JavaScript and interacting with the DOM is the main part of the project
  * Start small by selecting some elements
  * What algorithms do you need to implement?
  * Create some functions to store repeatable steps
* You'll need to find a way to track the numbers pressed until the = is pressed
No need for chaining long calculations yet (see hard mode)
Step 5: Submit Completed Assignment

* This project should be on your Github Account
* Please submit the project with a URL to your Github project

Features to add in the future:
1. Limit the number of characters that can be displayed - round and or use scientific notation.
2. Make it so that the mathematical operators cannot be entered nor displayed until a number is first entered/displayed.
3. Make it so that the mathematical operators cannot be entered nor displayed until a number is first entered/displayed.
4. Make it so that the '.', nor the mathematical operators cannot be entered/displayed more than once after each number.
