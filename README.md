**Build a Calculator**  

This exercise will help you understand how to use JavaScript functions and algorithms. You will also work with the DOM and respond to user input.

Step 1: Set up your project

* Create an `index.html` file
* Create a `main.css` file and link it to your `index.html` file
* Create a `main.js` file and link it to your `index.html` file
Step 2: Build the HTML

* Using the mockup provided below, create your HTML
Step 3: Apply the Styles

* Author CSS to match your HTML page to the mockup below.
Step 4: Write the JavaScript

* Writing the JavaScript and interacting with the DOM is the main part of the project
  * Start small by selecting some elements
  * What algorithms do you need to implement?
  * Create some functions to store repeatable steps
* You'll need to find a way to track the numbers pressed until the = is pressed
No need for chaining long calculations yet (see hard mode)
Step 5: Submit Completed Assignment

* This project should be on your Github Account
* Please submit the project with a URL to your Github project

## Hard Mode  
You should find the above project challenging, however here are extra features you should attempt to add in.

* Chain complex calculations.
 * Ex: `5 + 5 - 4 / 10`
 * Take into account order of operation
 * You'll need a way to manage state if you do this
* Add a button to calculate the Modulo of 2 numbers
* Add a button to calculate the Square Root of 2 numbers
* Add a decimal button
* Keep track of all the calculations so that you can scroll back through them

Features to add in the future:
1. Limit the number of characters that can be displayed - round and or use scientific notation.
2. Make it so that the mathematical operators cannot be entered nor displayed until a number is first entered/displayed.
3. Make it so that the mathematical operators cannot be entered nor displayed until a number is first entered/displayed.
4. Make it so that the '.', nor the mathematical operators cannot be entered/displayed more than once after each number.
